# publish-node-package

GitHub action to publish a NodeJS package to NPM and GitHub Packages.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml). Make sure you've stored a NPM classic token (an
"Automation" token) as a secret in your repository. You can generate an NPM
token at
[https://www.npmjs.com/settings/your-username/tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/your-username/tokens).

## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Publish my node package

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Publish
        uses: colinparsonsme/publish-node-package@v1
        with:
          # you can store your NPM token with any name in your repository secrets
          # assuming it's stored as NPM_TOKEN here
          npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }} # optional
          # your github token is always accessed by ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          # since it's autogenerated by GitHub on each job
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # optional; must be used with scope
          scope: '@my-username-or-organization' # optional; must be used with github-token
```
